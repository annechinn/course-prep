Who knows what a the MERN Stack stands for?

M - Mongo DB
E - Express JS
R - React
N - Node.js

Which of those run on the client vs the server?

We're missing some important technologies. Any ideas?

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Let's break down what a web application consists of
and where the "Tech Stack" fits in.

Bring up Google.com

Simple web page, right? Let's break down the parts.

    - type in URL, page shows up, where did the page come from?
    - web server (computer) - returns page requests, image, css, pdf
    - not part of your developer team job

    - just an input box....type something in.. what happens?
    - search suggestions.... where are those coming from?
    - client code talks to server code, typing so far, what's a good match?
    - look at network activity
    - who's listening? Express JS, but it's just a bridge
    - how to access data in database? need to write code.... JavaScript
    - JavaScript is special, can't run just anywhere, needs container, like a web browser, Node.js
    - where are those suggestions coming from? stored in a database.

client
    - markup to display the page - HTML, CSS, React/JavaScript
    - code to communicate with code on the server - JavaScript
    - code to update the HTML as server returns new data - JavaScript/React
server
    - code to listen for client  - Express.JS
    - code to go get data - JavaScript/Node.JS
    - database to store data - MongDB

Alternatives? 
    - tons
    - substitute Angular for React, MERN->MEAN

 Why MERN?
    - React is most popular (now).
    - React vs Angular
    - JavaScript - one language, easier than C#, JavaScript
    - DB - easier, non-relational
