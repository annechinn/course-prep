      <p>Welcome all! Follow through this simple web page as we talk briefly about the usage of semantic elements in HTML5</p>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <h4>What Are Semantics?</h4>
      <p>Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.<br><br>
Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.</p>
      <h4>What Are HTML5 Semantic Elements?</h4>
      <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br><br>

Examples of non-semantic elements: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; - Tells nothing about its content.<br><br>

Examples of semantic elements: &lt;article&gt;, &ltsection&gt, and &ltaside&gt - Clearly defines its content.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="header-element">
      <h3>2. Header</h3>
      <p>The &ltheader&gt element specifies a header for a document or section.<br>
        The &lt;header&gt; element should be used as container for introductory content and multiple &lt;header&gt; elements can be used throughout your web page!
      </p>
      <h4>Header Element vs. Heading Tags</h4>
      <p>By now, I more than sure you know about the varying heading tags. The heading tags range from &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;. These tags are good to use for topic headings throughout a webpage for emphasis. The header element is a block level element that can contain other elements contain introductory information for the web page. The header element will more than likely contain heading tags.</p>
    </article>
    <article="nav-element">
      <h3>3. Nav</h3>
      <p>The &lt;nav&gt; element is used for site navigation. Menu items can be created with this element and multiple elements of this type can be used throughout a webpage.</p>
      <section>
        <pre>(*You may notice that towards the top of the page that a &ltnav&gt element has been utilized for easier navigation to topics!)</pre>
      </section>
      <!-- This is an example of an aside semantic element in use. -->
      <aside>
        <p>
        It is common to hav global navigation across the top of the webpage and local navigation in a sidebar.
        </p>
      </aside>
    </article>
    <article id="section-element">
      <h3>4. Section</h3>
      <p>
        A section semantic element is defined as a thematic grouping of content, usually with a heading. Section blocks of code normally will not make sense on their own if extracted from a web page.
      </p>
      <section>
        <p>Sections! Oh how we love sections!</p>
        <pre>
        &uarr; Did you notice this wording? If we were to extract from elsewhere it would not make sense! This is a prime example of a section element, because it needs surrounding content for context!
</pre>
      </section>
    </article>
    <article id="article-element">
      <h3>5. Article</h3>
      <p>The &lt;article&gt; element specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to independently read from the rest of the site. </p>
      <section>
        <p>The section of wording above is an example of an article. It as well as the rest of the numbered topics can stand alone on the Internet.</p>
      </section>
      <h4>Article vs. Section</h4>
      <p>
        Article and section elements are similar in nature in that both are block level elements used for sectioning content. Both are highly useful and offer even more information to the browser for context, but the major difference between these two elements is that an article can stand alone and a section can not stand alone.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article id="aside-element">
      <h3>6. Aside</h3>
      <p>
        The aside elemenet is intended for content that is not part of the flow of the text as it appears. The information in the aside element will still be related in some way.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          This is an exmaple of an aside. Some type of terminology explanation or related content can be placed inside the &lt;aside&gt; element like a sidebar.
        </p>
      </aside>
    </article>
    <article id="footer-element">
      <h3>7. Footer</h3>
      <p>
        A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.<br>

You may have several &lt;footer&gt; elements in one document.
      </p>
      <!-- This is an example of a footer -->
      <footer>
        <p>Posted by: Allaysia Roberts</p>
  <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
  someone@example.com</a>.</p>
      </footer>
    </article>
    <article id="span-div-elements">
      <h3>Useful Non-Semantic Elements</h3>
      <p>With <mark>new features</mark> available in <strong>HTML5</strong>, the introduction of new semantic elements allow for greater page context understanding by the web browser. There are still extremely useful non-semantic tags that can aid in page creation significantly. Let's take a look.</p>
      <h4>Span</h4>
      <p>This element is a generic in-line styling element useful for manipulating the way content looks by allowing the author to target specific content.<br>
        In this sentence, I want to emphasize the word <span style="background-color:powderblue;">"styling"</span> with the span element. As you can see, the word styling was targeted directly to change its individual background to a blue color.
      </p>
      <section>
        <p>
          Span should be used when no other semantic element would be appropriate on the content of the web page.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h4>Div</h4>
      <p>The &lt;div&gt; element is a generic content container that can pretty much hold anything. When no other semantic element would be appropriate for content, the &lt;div&gt; element can be used in place of other elements. Let's take a look at the usage of the &lt;div&gt; element.</p>
      <div>
        <p>This content is in such a generic container and I would like to showcase an image.
          <summary>W3C Logo
            <details>
              <figure>
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/">
                <img src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png" alt="W3C Logo"></a><figcaption>Fig. 1 - Redistributable W3C Logo with link to W3C Home Page</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </details>
          </summary>
          See? Isn't HTML5 fun to learn? Until next time! Ciao!
