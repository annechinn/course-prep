// Given an array of characters where each character represents a
//  fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put
//  maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is 
// that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you 
// have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you 
// cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third 
// fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in 
// both the baskets.
